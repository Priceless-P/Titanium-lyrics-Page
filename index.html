          <p>
            [Verse 1]<br />
            You shout it out<br />
            But I can't hear a word you say<br />
            I'm talking loud, not saying much<br />
            I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet<br />
            Shoot me down, but I get up
          </p>
          
          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose<br />
            Fire away, fire away<br />
            Ricochet, you take your aim<br />
            Fire away, fire away
          </p>
          
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            You shoot me down, but I won't fall<br />
            I am titanium<br />
            You shoot me down, but I won't fall<br />
            I am titanium
          </p>
           <br />
          <p>
            [Verse 2]<br />
            Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall<br />
            Ghost town and haunted love<br />
            Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones<br />
            Talking loud, not saying much
          </p>

          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose<br />
            Fire away, fire away<br />
            Ricochet, you take your aim<br />
            Fire away, fire away
          </p>
          
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            You shoot me down, but I won't fall<br />
            I am titanium<br />
            You shoot me down, but I won't fall<br />
            I am titanium
